## Level Goal : ##
>The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**


## Commands you may need to solve this level : ##
man,grep,sort,uniq,strings,base64,tr,tar,gzip,bzip2,xxd

## PROCEDURE : ##

For this task we'll be using a tool called `grep` which is one of the built-in tools in Linux.

`grep` is a vey handy tool that allows us to filter the contents of file.  In our case we can use it to print the line that contains the string `millionth` in the file called `data.txt` as follows:

```console
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep "millionth" data.txt
millionth       TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP
```

We can also *pipe* the output of a command using the `|` character (called a 'pipe') to `grep` to filter the output generated by the command.  In our case we can use `cat` to output the contents of the file and grep to filter that output for the string `millionth`:

```console
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep "millionth"
millionth       TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP
```

In both cases, the output is identical but it is handy to know how to use both methods as these might come in useful in different scenarios.
