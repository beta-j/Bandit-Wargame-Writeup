# Bandit Level 24 -> Level 25 #

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit26.html

## SSH Access Details ##
**Username:**  bandit25

**Password:**  p7TaowMYrmu23Ol8hiZh9UvD0O9hpx8d

#

## Level Goal : ##
>Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.


## Commands you may need to solve this level : ##
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

#  
## PROCEDURE : ##

If we try to log in over ssh with the credentials for `bandit25`, we appear to be succesfully logged in, but kicked out of the session immediatly.  It seems like we're facing a similar scenario to what we had in [Level18 -> Level19](Level18%20->%20Level19.md) .

```console
bandit25@bandit:~$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p 2220
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2220 ([127.0.0.1]:2220)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:C2ihUBV7ihnV1wUXRb4RrEcLfXC5CXlhmAAM/urerLY.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Could not create directory '/home/bandit25/.ssh' (Permission denied).

In Level18 -> Level19 we had used the ssh command with the `-t` switch, so perhaps it's worth trying that again here:


```console
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
bandit25:x:11025:11025:bandit level 25:/home/bandit25:/bin/bash
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```
