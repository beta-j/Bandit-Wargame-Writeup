# Bandit Level 13 -> Level 14 #

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit14.html

## Level Goal : ##
>The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** and can only be read by user **bandit14**. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note: localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on


## Commands you may need to solve this level : ##
ssh,telnet,nc,openssl,s_client,nmap

#  
## PROCEDURE : ##

Things are startiung to get a bit more interesting now.  If we look into the contents of our home directory we can see that we've been given a file called `sshkey.private` which is the private key for a SSH connection.

```console
bandit13@bandit:~$ cd /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
-bash: cd: /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14: Not a directory
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
```

We can use this private key with the `ssh` command using the `-i` switch to start a ssh session as `bandit14`

```console
bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh bandit14@localhost -p 2220 -i sshkey.private
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2220 ([127.0.0.1]:2220)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:C2ihUBV7ihnV1wUXRb4RrEcLfXC5CXlhmAAM/urerLY.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh' (Permission denied).
