# Bandit Level 16 -> Level 17 #

https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit17.html

## Level Goal : ##
>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.



## Commands you may need to solve this level : ##
ssh,telnet,nc,openssl,s_client,nmap

#  
## PROCEDURE : ##

Since we don't know which port we need to use for this task we will need to use the `nmap` tool which allows us to scan a range of IPs for open ports.  In this case we only need to scan `localhost` in the port range `31000` to `32000`.

```console
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-04-02 10:17 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown
```

From the output of this command we can only see that there are 5 different ports that are open (i.e. there is a server listening on them) but we don't know which ones "speak SSL".  For that we need to add the `-sV` switch to the command which tells `nmap` to also attempt to dtermine what services are running on the ports it discovers:

```console
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap localhost -sV -p 31000-32000
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-04-02 10:17 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00014s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
31046/tcp open  echo
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
31691/tcp open  echo
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo
```

Now we can tell that only ports `31518` and `31790` are listening for SSL and port `31518` is also running `echo` service - i.e. it will repeat everything you send to it, whereas port `31790` is runnign an `unknown` service - so it is most likely that the port we're looking for is `31790`.

We can try connecting to it using `openssl` similarly to what we did in the [previous task](Levels/Level15 -> Level 16.md):


```console
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client localhost:31790
CONNECTED(00000003)
